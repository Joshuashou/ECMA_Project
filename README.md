# ECMA_Project
Ecma Fuzzy Diff in Disc Project


These are our coding files for our Final Project on Fuzzy Difference in Discontinuities. 

Explanation of the files below:
"CHIP_DiD.ipynb" is the jupyter notebook describing our Difference in Differences model. 

"ECMA RDD CHIP.ipynb" is our jupyter notebook describing our Regression Discontinuity Design model. 

"Fuzzy Diff in Disc" is our jupyter notebook describing our incorporation of the novel Fuzzy Differences in Discontinuities Model. 

and Finally, the main.py file runs results for all 3. To see all results, run "python3 Main.py" in the terminal
